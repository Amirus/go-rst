            The bubble-up parser strategy conflicts with short titles
            (<= 3 char-long over- & underlines).
    <section ids="two" names="two">
        <title>
            Two
        <paragraph>
            The parser currently contains a work-around kludge.
            Without it, the parser ends up in an infinite loop.
